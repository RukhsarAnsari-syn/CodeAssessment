      <p>
         Dear Eileen,<br>
         Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's 
         science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD
         </abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting dates</h2>
      <p>
         We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however
         it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start
         dates for each one are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>first semester:9 September 2016</li>
         <li>Second semester:15 january 2017</li>
         <li>Third semester:2 May 2017</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
